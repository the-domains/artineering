description: "In this blog post I'm going to start exploring the topic of blur filters. My original intention was to... - Provide an overview and optimization ideas for a few of the popular real time image blur filters, applicable on very different range of hardware (from sub-4W mobile device GPUs to high end 250W+ desktop GPUs)."
